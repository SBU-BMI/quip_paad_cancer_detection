# Pancreas cancer (PAAD) detection pipeline

This software implements the pipeline for the Pancrease cancer detection project. 

# Dependencies

 - [Pytorch 0.4.0](http://pytorch.org/)
 - Torchvision 0.2.0
 - cv2 (3.4.1)
 - [Openslide 1.1.1](https://openslide.org/api/python/)
 - [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
 - [PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.1.x/reference/Image.html)

# List of folders and functionalities are below: 

- scripts/: contains scripts that connect several sub-functionalities together for complete functionalities such as generating camicroscope heatmaps given svs images.

- conf/: contains configuration. 

- data/: a place where should contain all logs, input/output images, trained CNN models, and large files. 

- download_heatmap/: downloads grayscale lymphocyte or tumor heatmaps

- heatmap_gen/: generate json files that represents heatmaps for camicroscope, using the lymphocyte and necrosis CNNs' raw output txt files. 

- patch_extraction_tumor_40X/: extracts all patches from svs images. Mainly used in the test phase. 

- prediction/: CNN prediction code. 

- training/: CNN training code. 

# Docker Instructions 

Build the docker image by: 

docker build -t cancer_prediction .  (Note the dot at the end). 

## Step 1:
Create folder named "data" and subfoders below on the host machine:

- data/svs: to contains *.svs files
- data/patches: to contain output from patch extraction
- data/log: to contain log files
- data/heatmap_txt: to contain prediction output
- data/heatmap_jsons: to contain prediction output as json files

## Step 2:
- Run the docker container as follows: 

nvidia-docker run --name cancer_prediction_pipeline -itd -v <path-to-data>:/data -e CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES='<cuda device id>' cancer_prediction svs_2_heatmap.sh 

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES -- set to select the GPU to use 

The following example runs the cancer detection pipeline. It will process images in /home/user/data/svs and output the results to /home/user/data. 

nvidia-docker run --name cancer_prediction_pipeline -itd -v /home/user/data:/data -e CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES='0' cancer_prediction svs_2_heatmap.sh
